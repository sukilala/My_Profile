	Interest in IT
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	My interest in IT has been a lifelong obsession, ever since I was a kid, I
	always had a particular interest in technology over other things, when I
	was about 7 my father showed me my first experience of a website, I was
	honestly more interested in how it worked than the information it
	displayed, that was one of the first instances of me liking IT. I currently
	have no actual experience in IT apart from the IT electives i took during
	my grade school years.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	I chose to study at RMIT because it was the only university that had a
	Bachelors in Information Technology on OUA (Open University Australia), and
	also I have previous experience studying at RMIT as I studied a course on
	campus before i decided it was not for me, even though the course was not
	for me i quite liked the student experience provided by RMIT and that
	played a part in me deciding what and where to study.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	I expect to learn the basics of IT by studying the course Introduction to
	Programming and Introduction to Information Technology before i go on to
	study the Bachelor of Information Technology and also this is my first time
	studying online so I expect it will be a good learning experience to get
	the gist of the differences between on campus learning and online learning
	before I start a full-time degree.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	Ideal Job
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	My ideal job would be to someday be a Research Scientist specialising in
	Machine Learning like the advertisement posted at seek.com.au (Link and
	Spashot is below). The position is meant to help device novel techniques
	powered by Machine Learning algorithms to explore minerals and metals in a
	much more sustainable way. This role requires the researcher to have at
	least 4 years of experience in researching novel machine learning
	algorithms, preferably a Masters in Computer Science and expert level
	proficiency in a variety of programming languages. Inorder for me to
	qualify for this job I would have to finish two courses I am currently
	studying (IPT and ITT), and then finish the Bachelors in Information
	Technology, afterwards find a junior research job and get a Masters in
	Computer Science as i am doing my job and then hopefully in a half decade I
	would qualify for this job.

	These tests have shown what my true personality is, it's something I have
	never directly contemplated about but i think these personality tests will
	prove useful when I am working in a team environment, for example the
	career test prove that my need for leadership is low but my need for
	organization is high so my role in a team could include helping to organize
	the necessary objectives in regards to solving a problem.

	Project Idea - Carbon Dome a Martian Habitat
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	Overview
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	The following paper will attempt to describe the concept in everyday
	language, keeping numbers and jargon to a minimum. Inspired by the recent
	3-D printed habitat challenge presented by NASA, Structural Member
	Competition (Phase 2). Even such submissions to the challenge are now
	closed. The concept described below will attempt to provide a
	technologically and economically feasible method to solve the problem in
	establishing a permanent Martian habitat.

	Motivation
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	So What is Carbon Dome Anyway?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	The only way to thrive on Mars and not just survive, short of terraforming
	is to build a self-sustaining habitat on the Martian surface, but
	transporting the necessary resources to build such a habit would be far too
	uneconomical amongst a host of other problems. So this is when things get
	tricky.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	Description
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	One of the most innovative methods provided to solve this problem, is 3D
	printing. The idea goes as- by harvesting regolith or other forms of solid
	matter from the martian soil we could 3D print a Martian habitat layer by
	layer, but most methods are at best theoretical, as even to this day we
	still know very little about the composition of the martian soil.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
	But not to worry we have a proven natural resource on Mars we can use to
	build our habitat, carbon dioxide, yes, now I know what you may be
	thinking- carbon dioxide is a gas, how can we use it to build a solid
	structure? Not to worry I have got the answer, by using a system that uses
	electrolytic syntheses, the process provided below can make carbon
	nanofibers from atmospheric air, in this case, Mars. Here's how it will
	work:
</p>
<br/>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			To power, the synthesis, heat, and electricity are produced through
			a hybrid and extremely efficient concentrating solar-energy system.
			The system focuses the sun's rays on a photovoltaic solar cell to
			generate electricity and on a second system to generate heat and
			thermal energy, which raises the temperature of an electrolytic
			cell.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			CO2 is broken down in a high-temperature electrolytic bath of
			molten carbonates at 1,380 degrees F (750 degrees C).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			Atmospheric air is added to an electrolytic cell.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			The CO2 dissolves when subjected to the heat and direct current
			through electrodes of nickel and steel. The carbon nanofibers build
			up on the steel electrode, where they can be removed.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
	The following method was developed by a team of researchers at the George
	Washington University, presumably as a way to lower the potent greenhouse
	gas from our own atmosphere at the same time making it economical, but I
	realised a different yet not entirely different use for this technology
	which I will discuss in more detail further down the paper.

	Feasibility

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			Where would the power come from? Granted that the research paper
			does not explicitly say how energy intensive the process would be,
			but one of the lead researchers, Lindt estimates it would cost 1000
			dollars worth of electricity per ton of nanofibers, considering the
			average cost per kilowatt of electricity is 10 cents, it would take
			10000 kilowatt-hours to produce one ton worth of carbon nanofibres.
			The maximum solar irradiance on Mars is about 590 W/m2 compared to
			about 1000 W/m2 at the Earth's surface. Also, year-round dust
			storms on Mars may block sunlight for weeks at a time. In
			Equatorial regions such as the Martian Pavonis Mons, which is a
			great spot for this dome by the way but more on that later,
			receives about 12 hours worth of daylight hours per day, that means
			a solar array with an area of 100 square metres and an efficiency
			of 30 percent, would produce 212 kilowatt hours per day, which
			translates to 21 kilograms worth of carbon nanofibres per day. Now
			let's go back to the dust storm problem let's imagine every second
			day of the week blocks the sun entirely making the system inert,
			unlikely but not impossible, at that rate, we would produce 38 tons
			worth of carbon nanofibres within 10 years.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			Where would we build it? On top of a lava tube entrance of course,
			where else? This image below of a lava tube skylight entrance on
			the Martian volcano Pavonis Mons is only about 35 meters in
			diameter and the perfect candidate for our 3D printed dome. Lava
			tubes solve a host of problems that come with colonization of Mars
			such as dangerous levels of cosmic radiation that may be
			detrimental to the colonists long term health, gives a constant
			temperature forum in otherwise chaotic temperature fluctuations on
			top of the surface but they still lack one thing that is most dire,
			safe atmospheric pressure - that's where our dome comes into play,
			our dome would be 35 metres in diameter, 11.6 metres in height, has
			a thickness of 1 metre, and will weigh 35 tons.

		<p dir="ltr">
			How would we build it? The exact size of the system used to build
			the dome is not available but I presume it would not be much bigger
			than the mars rover and can come folded. Before we start printing
			the dome, screw pile steel foundation will need to be installed,
			this can be done using an autonomous rover, the steps as follows;
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			A small rover will clear the dust till, solid ground is visible,
			around the lava tube.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			Another rover will then place a steel plate and then drive steel
			tubular piles into the ground by a simple jackhammer and attachment
			tool, then a specially designed post and cap plate for easy fixing
			to bearer will be attached, 4 of these would be more than enough to
			handle the load of the dome.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">
			Then the carbon dioxide to carbon nanofibres system and the carbon
			nanofiber 3d printer, will start the printing process- first it
			will print around the edge of the lava tube using a rover, then
			slowly keep printing all the way to the top using a flywheel like
			system for about 10 years until the dome is complete.

	</li>
</ol>
